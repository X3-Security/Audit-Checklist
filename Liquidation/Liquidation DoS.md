### **üìù Checklist: Liquidation Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities**  

#### **üîç Why Check for Liquidation DoS Issues?**  
Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in liquidation can allow malicious users to **avoid liquidation**, **block liquidators**, or **increase gas costs** beyond practical limits. This leads to **bad debt accumulation** and threatens the protocol's solvency.

### **‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ General Checks for Liquidation DoS Risks**  
- [ ] **Does the protocol rely on iterating over an unbounded list of user positions during liquidation?**  
- [ ] **Can a user create many small positions (dust positions) to artificially increase gas costs?**  
- [ ] **Is there a minimum position size enforced to prevent spam positions?**  
- [ ] **Are there any gas-heavy operations inside the liquidation function?**  
- [ ] **Does the contract use an unbounded loop that scales with user activity?**  
- [ ] **Is there a max limit for how many positions a single user can open?**

### **üõ† 2Ô∏è‚É£ Checking for Forced Liquidation Failures**  
- [ ] **Does liquidation require checking multiple assets or multiple markets for each user?**  
- [ ] **Can a user spam assets into their collateral list to force excessive processing?**  
- [ ] **Is there a risk of liquidators running out of gas when attempting to liquidate a position?**  
- [ ] **Can users abuse the `enterMarkets()` function to add markets just before liquidation to increase gas costs?**  
- [ ] **Does liquidation include expensive calculations that could be abused to cause reverts?**  
- [ ] **Can a user repeatedly enter and exit markets to prevent their liquidation?**

### **üí∞ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Gas Efficiency in Liquidation**  
- [ ] **Does the contract enforce a gas-efficient data structure (e.g., mappings instead of arrays)?**  
- [ ] **Is the liquidation function optimized to avoid unnecessary state changes?**  
- [ ] **Does the contract batch liquidations instead of looping over each position individually?**  
- [ ] **Are gas refunds or efficient storage techniques used to mitigate high gas costs?**  
- [ ] **Are there mechanisms in place to allow partial liquidations to prevent full gas exhaustion?**  

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploitability Tests**  
- [ ] **Can an attacker force liquidators to consume excessive gas through many small positions?**  
- [ ] **Does liquidation involve looping through all open positions, making it vulnerable to DoS?**  
- [ ] **Can an attacker flood the system with near-worthless assets that must still be checked?**  
- [ ] **Are there scenarios where a large user (whale) cannot be liquidated due to gas limitations?**  
- [ ] **Can a user enter and exit markets right before liquidation to increase processing time?**  
- [ ] **Does liquidation require iterating over all debt positions, causing a gas bottleneck?**  

---

### **üöÄ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mitigation and Fixes**  
- [ ] **Implement a limit on the number of positions a single user can open.**  
- [ ] **Use mappings instead of arrays to store user positions for efficient lookups.**  
- [ ] **Enforce a minimum position size to prevent dust positions from being abused.**  
- [ ] **Optimize gas usage in liquidation by removing redundant calculations.**  
- [ ] **Allow batch processing of liquidations instead of handling each position individually.**  
- [ ] **Use off-chain or oracle-based liquidation triggering to avoid expensive in-contract loops.**  
- [ ] **Prevent users from adding new markets before liquidation to artificially increase gas costs.**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Final Takeaway**  
üìå **Why This Matters?**  
- Liquidation should be **gas-efficient and resistant to spam attacks**.  
- **Attackers must not be able to block their own liquidation** by increasing gas costs.  
- **Bad debt should not accumulate** due to liquidators being unable to complete transactions.  

üìå **Next Steps:**  
- **Simulate a large number of small positions** to check if gas limits are exceeded.  
- **Analyze how liquidation behaves with different collateral types and large user accounts.**  
- **Review storage structures** to ensure efficiency and scalability in liquidation execution.
